Assignment 4

Problem1: Download gene sequence of β-amylase gene of human from NCBI and find out GC content
(the fraction of letters that are a C or a G) to classify the genome into high-GC regions (on average 60%
G or C) and Low-GC regions (on average 60% A or T). Write a program to find out following

1. Calculates the mean length of High-GC and Low-GC regions, and plots a histogram of the
lengths of the High-GC and Low-GC regions.
2. Find out the length of the gene and number of pitches
3. Find out the ‘reverse’ complementary sequence

Problem 2: Write a program to find out the percentage of polar amino acid present in a protein sequence.
Also find out the position of the each of the polar amino acids (consider N-terminal amino acid is the first
amino acid in the protein sequence).
