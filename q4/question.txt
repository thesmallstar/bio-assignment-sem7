Assignment 4

Problem1: Download gene sequence of β-amylase gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae from NCBI and
find out GC content (the fraction of letters that are a C or a G) to classify the genome into high-GC 
regions (on average 60% G or C) and Low-GC regions (on average 60% A or T). Divide your sequence 
segment of 100 bases to get GC content. Write a program to find out following

1. Plots a histogram of the lengths of the High-GC and Low-GC regions.
2. Find out the length of the gene and number of pitches
3. Find out the ‘reverse’ complementary sequence

Problem 2: Write a program to find out the percentage of polar amino acid present in a protein sequence.
Also find out the position of the each of the polar amino acids (consider N-terminal amino acid is the first
amino acid in the protein sequence).

Problem 3: Perform multiple sequence alignment on three or more sequences.
