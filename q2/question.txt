Assignment 2

Problem1: Download DNA sequence of insulin gene of human, rat and cow from NCBI and find out GC 
content (the fraction of letters that are a C or a G) to classify the genome into high-GC regions (on 
average 60% G or C) and Low-GC regions (on average 60% A or T). Write a program to find out 
following. Divide your sequence 200 bases to get GC content.

1. Plots a histogram of the lengths of the High-GC and Low-GC regions.
2. Calculate number of H-bonds for each organism
3. Find out the number of ‘GAAT’ sequence repeats in case of above gene for human

Problem 2: Given a DNA sequence (sense strand), write a program to find out Complementary sequence,
Corresponding mRNA sequence and Protein sequence.

Problem 3: Retrieve the secondary structure of a protein from Protein Data Bank (PDB) database of
insulin gene of human. Also, perform sequence alignment using FASTA tool.
